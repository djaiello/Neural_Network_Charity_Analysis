p# Module 20 Challenge: Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
   The purpose of this analysis is With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

   From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization

## Results: 
   Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

- Data Preprocessing
-- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
-- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
-- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
-- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

   There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)

## Summary: 
    Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
